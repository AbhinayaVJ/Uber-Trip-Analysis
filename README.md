Uber Trip Analysis Machine Learning Project
 Project Overview
 The goal of this project is to analyze Uber trip data to identify patterns and build a
 predictive model for trip demand. The analysis will cover various aspects such as popular
 pickup times, busiest days, and fare prediction.
 Dataset
 The dataset used for this project is typically Uber's trip data, which includes details such
 as:
 ● Date/Time: When the trip started.
 ● Lat: Latitude of the pickup.
 ● Lon: Longitude of the pickup.
 ● Base: TLC base company code affiliated with the Uber pickup.
 Uber provides various datasets on platforms like Kaggle, which you can download for
 analysis.
